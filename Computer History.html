            Computers have been around for a long time now. Here is the time line of them.

            <p>
                <b>
                    Approximately 3000 BC

            This all started with the Abacus. It was created because people could not count higher than 10 so they invented this. It hav two rows one big one with 5 little peges and then a little strip on top of it with 2 pegs.  Their are some people that still us Abacus.

            It went from a rectangle to something that is faster. That could do exactly what Abacus faster and it was smaller. They just made made something that was faster.  (1960s)  They became very common in 1960s.The Calculator is a small, portable electronic device used to perform both basic operations of arithmetic and complex mathematical operations.

            Later, during the 1800s, came out with the punch cards. This is a piece of stiff paper that contains digital information represented by the presence or absence of holes in predefined positions. Punched cards were widely used through much of the 20th century in what became known as the data processing industry, where specialized and increasingly complex unit record machines, organized into data processing systems, used punched cards for data input, output, and storage.

            They went even further then the punch card they made the computer. The ENIAC was invented by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly at the University of Pennsylvania and began construction in 1943 and was not completed until 1946. It occupied about 1,800 square feet and used about 18,000 vacuum tubes, weighing almost 50 tons. There are many claims of making the first computer like The Colossus was the first electronic programmable computer, developed by Tommy Flowers, and first demonstrated in December 1943. The Colossus was created to help the British code breakers read encrypted German messages.

            Two individuals who each sought a smaller and more friendly computer were Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.They opened a company named Apple. Jobs and Wozniak started out building in Jobs' garage and sold them without a monitor, keyboard, or casing. Jobs then hired John Sculley to be president. However, this move backfired and after much controversy with Sculley, Jobs left in 1985 and went on to new and bigger things. He founded his own company NeXT Software and he also bought Pixar from George Lucas, which would later become a huge success in computer animation of such movies as Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Monsters, Inc., and Finding Nemo.

        <p>
            Apple became a very successful company. It has made iPods, iPads, and iPhones, among other devices. When Jobs hired John Sculley the company started to diminish and then Apple is desperately looking for a modern operating system to buy, and eventually chose to purchase NeXT for $400 million.
